## Acquisition
The Kebia berry can be mutated by equipping the [[Rocky Helmet]] while there is a ripe [[Pamtre]] berry in the [[Farm]]. The Pamtre berry will mutate into a Kebia berry.

If the "No Oak Items" challenge is on, the Kebia berry can be bought from the Johto Berry Master for 10,000 Farm Points.
